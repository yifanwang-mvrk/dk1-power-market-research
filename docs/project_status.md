# Project Status / 项目进度

**Project:** DK1 Short-Term Power Market Research
**Last updated:** 2026-09-06
**Design baseline:** Frozen MVP Blueprint v1.1

## Current Position / 当前定位

| Item | Current Status |
|---|---|
| Completed phase | P0 — Project Control & Environment |
| Current phase | P1 — Data Source Validation |
| Current step | P1.2 — Validate DK1 day-ahead price |
| Next step | P1.3 — Validate DK1 balancing price |
| Current milestone | Level A — CV-safe |
| Milestone status | NOT ACHIEVED |
| Holdout | LOCKED and unused |
| Blocker | None |

## One Current Action / 当前唯一动作

Validate the official DK1 day-ahead price dataset, field meaning, currency, delivery-hour key and development-period coverage.

核验 DK1 day-ahead price 的官方数据集、价格字段、币种、交付小时键和开发期覆盖率。

## P1.1 Completion / Forecasts_Hour 核验结论

**Status:** CONDITIONAL PASS — completed 2026-09-06

- Official dataset ID, fields, units, DK1 selector and forecast types registered
- Full local-date development boundary validated with zero holdout records
- `HourUTC + PriceArea + ForecastType` validated as the canonical key
- Same-row 5h-to-1h revision is feasible with approximately 99% numeric pair coverage
- Missing rows and nulls must be excluded and never filled with zero
- Observed zero and negative forecasts must be preserved with quality flags
- Solar requires an all-pairs view and a both-positive sensitivity view
- UTC is required for joins; local time is retained for DST interpretation
- `TimestampUTC` belongs to `ForecastCurrent`, not the 5h/1h publication times
- Fixed-horizon research is supported; complete tick-by-tick vintage claims are prohibited
- Exact simulated decision cutoff remains an explicit P2.3 item

## Frozen Research Controls / 冻结研究规则

- Development period: 2022-01-01 to 2024-06-30
- Locked holdout: 2024-07-01 to 2024-12-31
- Target: `Spread_t = P_Balancing,t - P_DayAhead,t`
- Neutral band: development-only Q25 of nonzero absolute spreads
- Mandatory baselines: majority class and persistence
- Primary MVP hypothesis: H2 renewable forecast revision
- No executable intraday P&L claim
- Holdout access remains prohibited

## Prepared Reference / 参考版本

Earlier assistant-prepared P1.1 files remain outside the formal repository as reference material and did not count as completion evidence. The formal P1.1 was subsequently performed, reviewed and recorded through the guided process in this repository.

## Session Log / 工作记录

| Date | Completed | Current / Next |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-09-05 | P0 repository and environment setup completed | Current: P1.1; Next: P1.2 |
| 2026-09-06 | P1.1 `Forecasts_Hour` completed with a conditional pass | Current: P1.2; Next: P1.3 |

Update this file after every completed work session. Every DONE status requires reviewed evidence.
