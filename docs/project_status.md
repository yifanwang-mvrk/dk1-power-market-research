## One Current Action / 当前唯一动作

Construct the same-hour EUR/MWh balancing spread from the P2 hourly base while
preserving the documented missing balancing outcome.

使用 P2 小时底表构造同小时 EUR/MWh balancing spread，并保留已记录的 balancing outcome 缺口。

## P1.1 Completion / Forecasts_Hour 核验结论

**Status:** CONDITIONAL PASS — completed 2026-09-06

- Official dataset ID, fields, units, DK1 selector and forecast types registered
- Full local-date development boundary validated with zero holdout records
- `HourUTC + PriceArea + ForecastType` validated as the canonical key
- Same-row 5h-to-1h revision is feasible with approximately 99% numeric pair coverage
- Missing rows and nulls must be excluded and never filled with zero
- Observed zero and negative forecasts must be preserved with quality flags
- Solar requires an all-pairs view and a both-positive sensitivity view
- UTC is required for joins; local time is retained for DST interpretation
- `TimestampUTC` belongs to `ForecastCurrent`, not the 5h/1h publication times
- Fixed-horizon research is supported; complete tick-by-tick vintage claims are prohibited
- Exact simulated decision cutoff remains an explicit P2.3 item

## P1.2 Completion / DK1 Day-Ahead Price 核验结论

**Status:** PASS — completed 2026-09-06

- Official legacy dataset `Elspotprices` (ID 30) registered for the declared period
- `SpotPriceEUR` selected as `P_DayAhead,t` in EUR/MWh
- Full local-date development boundary contains all 21,887 expected hours
- Zero missing hours, zero duplicate primary-key rows and zero holdout rows
- `HourUTC + PriceArea` validated as the canonical key; filter area to DK1
- `HourDK` retained for interpretation and DST checks only
- Zero and negative day-ahead prices preserved as market observations
- `SpotPriceDKK` retained for audit but excluded from the EUR spread
- Exact row-level publication timestamps are unavailable and remain in P2.3
- Future data after 2025-09-30 requires the successor `DayAheadPrices` dataset

## P1.3 Completion / DK1 Balancing Outcome 核验结论

**Status:** CONDITIONAL PASS — completed 2026-09-06

- Official legacy dataset `RegulatingBalancePowerdata` (ID 122) registered
- `ImbalancePriceEUR` selected as `P_Balancing,t` in EUR/MWh
- Target classified as an ex-post `outcome`, never a decision-time feature
- All 21,886 returned development rows contain the selected target price
- Every target value matches the official Up price, Down price or both
- One of 21,887 expected hours is absent: `2022-10-30T00:00:00Z`
- A separate bounded official API request confirmed the same DST fall-back gap
- Zero duplicate-key rows, zero extra rows and zero holdout rows
- Missing row must remain missing; zero, negative and extreme prices are retained
- Nordic single-price go-live on 2021-11-01 precedes the whole development period
- Active 15-minute `ImbalancePrice` successor starts in 2025 and is not mixed in
- Exact historical publication delay is undocumented and remains under I03/P2.3
- Outcome is a balancing-pressure proxy, not executable trading P&L

## P1.4 Completion / Fundamentals and System Sources 核验结论

**Status:** PASS — completed 2026-09-06

- `ProductionConsumptionSettlement` passed all development-boundary, key and
  completeness checks with 21,887 DK1 hours and zero holdout rows
- Actual wind, actual solar and actual residual load were defined for H1-A and
  classified `diagnostic_only` because settlement values arrive after delivery
- Negative actual residual load occurs in 5,974 hours and is preserved as a
  physical observation rather than treated as missing
- Actual cross-border settlement fields are diagnostic; GB source-defined
  historical nulls remain null
- `Transmissionlines` covers all development hours and six DK1 connections
- Day-ahead capacities and `ScheduledExchangeDayAhead` are conditional
  decision candidates pending exact P2.3 cutoff mapping and P6.1 border rules
- Mixed `ExportCapacity` signs and unavailable GB day-ahead fields are
  documented conditions, not silently repaired
- Final intraday schedules and physical exchange are diagnostic only
- Legacy `CountertradeIntraday` is a partial-period conditional candidate:
  7,447 of 7,751 final rows were published at least one hour before delivery,
  while overwritten earlier versions cannot be reconstructed
- The 2025 countertrade successor is unavailable for the development period
- No validated Energi Data Service historical load forecast was identified;
  the ENTSO-E day-ahead load forecast remains an external P5.2 candidate
- Reserve-capacity and real-time sources were registered with explicit
  candidate or diagnostic status; no unvalidated field was promoted
- A reproducible validator, raw-data manifests and a machine-readable source
  eligibility inventory are preserved under `research/evidence/p1_4_sources/`
- Holdout remained locked and unused; missing values were never converted to zero

## P2 Completion / Development Data Pipeline 完成结论

**Status:** PASS — P2.1 through P2.5 completed 2026-09-06

- P2.1 added a reusable Energi Data Service client that rejects pre-development,
  holdout, non-DK1 and unbounded area requests before network access
- A live DK1 development-only day sample returned all 24 expected hourly spot
  rows; automated checks cover 429 retry handling and truncated responses
- P2.2 preserved six exact P1 raw JSON responses with request, retrieval and
  SHA-256 provenance; every current hash matches its P1 manifest
- P2.3 standardized local-date request boundaries, UTC joins, Danish-local
  interpretation, UTC offsets and repeated DST-hour occurrence
- The decision anchor is `delivery_start_utc`; only information available
  strictly before that anchor belongs to the last-pre-delivery snapshot
- Non-null `Forecast5Hour` and `Forecast1Hour` values are eligible at that
  snapshot under the official pre-delivery availability rule; no exact-minute
  or complete-vintage claim is made
- `ImbalancePriceEUR` remains an outcome; actual settlement fundamentals and
  realized flows remain diagnostic only
- Day-ahead transmission fields pass the timing gate but remain conditional on
  P6.1 border/sign rules
- Countertrade uses `PublicationDate < delivery_start_utc`; 7,469 of 7,751
  stored rows pass, while 282 fail the cutoff and absent days remain unknown
- Previous-hour spread/label persistence remains an ex-post reference because
  the legacy outcome publication delay is undocumented
- P2.4 produced a local 93-column hourly base with 21,887 unique DK1 hours
- P2.5 passed all boundary, key, DST, coverage, unit and eligibility checks
- Spot price has zero gaps; the single balancing gap at
  `2022-10-30T00:00:00Z` remains null; holdout rows remain zero
- Evidence: `research/evidence/p2_data_pipeline/`; local processed table:
  `data/processed/p2/hourly_base_development.parquet`

## Prepared Reference / 参考版本

Earlier assistant-prepared P1.1 files remain outside the formal repository as reference material and did not count as completion evidence. The formal P1.1 was subsequently performed, reviewed and recorded through the guided process in this repository.
